In the game of Nim, the number of objects in each pile can vary widely, as the game rules don’t specify a standard amount. Instead, the number of piles and objects is usually chosen to create strategic depth, and configurations can range from simple to highly complex. Here’s a look at some common setups:

Traditional Setup: The game often starts with three or four piles, each containing a different number of objects (such as 3, 4, and 5 objects), allowing players to engage in a strategic challenge without the game lasting too long.

Small-Scale Setup: For quicker games or beginner practice, smaller configurations are typical. For example, having 3 piles with 1-5 objects each can make the game easier to analyze while teaching the basic winning strategies.

Larger-Scale Setup: For more complex versions, the game might start with larger piles, sometimes exceeding 10 objects per pile or having more than four piles. For example, a challenging setup might be four piles with 3, 7, 8, and 12 objects each.

Custom Configurations: Some players enjoy experimenting with different pile counts and object amounts to explore unique strategies. For instance, the “Misère” version of Nim (where the goal is to avoid taking the last object) can make even simple configurations more challenging.

The choice of pile amounts can change the complexity and length of a Nim game, but the aim is often to allow a fair amount of strategy without the game becoming overwhelming.
