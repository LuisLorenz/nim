## plan 
-[x] seeing the computer has made a move 
-[x] implement the nice illustration of flow writing fully  
-[x] random pile choice
    - pile_options = [12, 15, 9]
    - better: a radome number in a range (10-20) 
-[ ] player vs player choice 
-[ ] record counter
-[ ] changing rules (randomly)
    - making it harder with time pressure to force people to make a quick decision
-[ ] smartening up the code ... 
-[ ] implement illustrations with o's as item amount in pile
    - also items of player for a different rule set
-[ ] making  the game more challenging with multiple piles
    - research how to make this game more advanced
