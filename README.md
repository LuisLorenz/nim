[## principle ](https://realpython.com/python-minimax-nim/)

## plan 
-[x] seeing the computer has made a move 
-[x] implement the nice illustration of flow writing fully  
-[x] random pile choice
    - pile_options = [12, 15, 9]
    - better: a radome number in a range (10-20) 

## plan v3
-[x] player vs player choice 
    - choosing between playing again AI or not 
    - yes or no questition
            - select "player" or "computer" 
    - creating game_1 & game_2 would work but would be copy code 
    - better to have just one game >> better performance 
-[ ] record counter
-[ ] changing rules (randomly)
    - making it harder with time pressure to force people to make a quick decision
-[ ] smartening up the code ... 
-[ ] implement illustrations with o's as item amount in pile
    - also items of player for a different rule set
-[ ] making  the game more challenging with multiple piles
    - research how to make this game more advanced
-[ ] random player that starts the game 

... 
-[ ] giving my code to AI for evaluation and improvement
